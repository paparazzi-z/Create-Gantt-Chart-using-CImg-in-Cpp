# Create-Gantt-Chart-using-CImg-in-Cpp

This is a simple C++ implementation for creating a Gnatt chart. It's only a small project in college for learning C++. So it's quite simple. And it's required to use the Library CImg which is rarely used nowadays I suppose. So JUST FOR FUN.

It can realize the fonctions such as adding,deleting,modify a task, saving/reading a chart and zoom in a chart(searching a period of time in a chart).

Just clone the project and run the main.cpp. Perhaps there are some issues of path because I create some folder here.

And maybe some words are written in FRENCH!
